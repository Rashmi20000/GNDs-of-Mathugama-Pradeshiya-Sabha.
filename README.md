# GNDs-of-Mathugama-Pradeshiya-Sabha.
The Mathugama Pradeshiya Sabha administers several Grama Niladhari Divisions (GNDs) within its area. Each GND, led by a Grama Niladhari officer, provides essential local services, supports community welfare, and coordinates development initiatives. These divisions connect residents with the Sabha's infrastructure and public service projects.
